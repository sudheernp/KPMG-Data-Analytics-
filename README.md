# Sprocket Central Pty Ltd Customer Targeting Project

## Project Overview
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, has partnered with KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team to leverage data analytics and modeling expertise. The objective is to optimize their marketing strategy and identify high-value customers using a combination of existing and new datasets.

## Project Phases
This project is divided into three main phases:

### Phase 1: Data Exploration
In this phase, we explore the existing datasets (Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, Transactions data) and analyze data quality. We also incorporate a new list of 1000 potential customers for analysis.

### Phase 2: Model Development
We develop a predictive model to target high-value customers based on demographics and attributes. This phase involves feature engineering, data transformations, and model building.

### Phase 3: Interpretation
After building the model, we interpret the results and create visualizations to convey key findings. We use these insights to propose a marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

## Presentation
Our project presentation and visualizations can be found in the `presentation` directory.
